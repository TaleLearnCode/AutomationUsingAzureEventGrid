![Automation Using Azure Event Grid](Thumbnail.jpg)

## Abstract
The Azure Functions Event Grid trigger allows for the automation of tasks when certain events occur within the Azure ecosystem, such as when uploading images to a blob storage account. When a subscribed topic occurs, Event Grid detects the event and triggers the associated Azure Function. The Azure Function can then perform a specified task, such as creating a thumbnail of an uploaded image. This enables the automatic and efficient processing of pictures as soon as they are uploaded without requiring manual intervention. By using the Event Grid trigger in combination with Azure Functions, organizations can easily automate tasks related to image processing and streamline their workflows.

Come learn how to quickly build an automated image thumbnail generator with little code using the Azure Functions Event Grid trigger.
